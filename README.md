# About

This repo hosts documentation related to building an open, zoomable atlas for invasion science and beyond, as described in the grant proposal available at [https://doi.org/10.3897/neobiota.68.66685](https://doi.org/10.3897/neobiota.68.66685).

The key ideas behind the project are to expand on the existing [Hi-Knowledge](hi-knowledge.org/) prototype by
- annotating invasion biology resources (particularly articles and datasets) as to 
  - which specific research questions were addressed
  - how these research questions relate to invasion biology hypotheses
  - the degree to which these hypotheses are supported / refuted / not affected by these resources
- mapping the articles and annotations to Wikidata to make them explorable via
  - [Scholia](https://scholia.toolforge.org/), a scholarly profiling tool
  - [Open Knowledge Maps](https://openknowledgemaps.org/), a literature search engine
